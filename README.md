# CVPR-2025-Official-Implementation-Box-Free-Model-Watermarking-Decoder-Gradient-Shield
This is the official implementation of Decoder Gradient Shield: Provable and High-Fidelity Prevention of Gradient-Based Box-Free Watermark Removal (CVPR 2025).

Arxiv version is now available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20924).

Our proposed approach presents a closed-form solution for safeguarding box-free model watermarking against gradient-based watermark removal attacks. The pretrained victim models are available for download at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fPZq45xaB066blHmQ5oayGLhUCcZdqar?usp=sharing).

We have verified the effectiveness of our method on deraining and style transfer tasks and the code is easy to follow. Should you have any concern, please do not hesitate to contact me at [haonanan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk](mailto:haonanan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk). Thank you!
